transformers-either
==================

[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/transformers-either.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-either) 

Transformers built around EitherT (ExceptT compatible), keeping the consistent naming from Either and supplmenting it
with extra functionality not found in [transformers](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers) version of ExceptT.
